# Nesquick 2 - The Quickening (TBD)

## Introduction / Background

This project is designed to become highly un-inticpated sequal to the GE007
romehack "Project Nesquick".  This will be designed more as a redux of GE007
than a troll absurdist romhack (with humor still present).

There will be more work put into custom character scripts with new heads and
potentially new maps??

This document will serve as a working checklist / storyboard for each level.

## Level Ideas

### Dam

#### Overview

Overall theme:
 *  Segment the level into sections / pre-dam / damn upper / basement casino.
 *  If alarms are sounded the mission fails.
 *  Depending on difficulty will the depth and complexity of the level will vary.
 *  More switch usage.

The basis of the map for Dam is fairly complex and interesting, however the
current implementation of the level is very direct and doesn't encorage
exploration at all.  However, as with caverns caution should be held with
making things too complex as it becomes uninuitive how to actually progress
through the level.

#### Pre-double gate section

Starting point may be the same, however it would be great if we could
extend the intro area before the big metal door to add some interesting gameplay elements.

Starting from a latter in a basement/service area which exits into the tunnel
before the main staging area. Here we can add an interesting encounter in the
tunnel with a patrolling guard.

On initial exit of the tunnel we may attempt to add a barraks which would need to
be infiltrated in order to progress.

there should be at least 3/4 alarms which could be triggered. Most of which would
be due to making too much noise. (Barraks may be located at the "Barrels and Boxes")
area.

#### Lockshot Area

After the initial infiltration area the Comm Sat / "shutter" area should be a storage
area with an officer which holds the basement key.  There may also be a siwtch in the
upper tower to open the fence gate as is in the GE movie.

#### Upper Dam

Alarm guards at every post which may activate an alarm. In addition to a patrolling
guard at each section. Each tower should act as an entry point for each basement section.

Move comms dish to far section of the dam perhaps modify an exisitng tower?


#### Basement Lottery

Currently the basement is one continuous hallway. The vanilla does a good job of
placing the guards and breaking the basement into "sections" may not have a good
flow for the level? It may be worth trying by having many "computer rooms" where
security must be disabled. Perhaps moving the coms dish would be worth doing?


### Facility 

#### Overview

The level should be remixed quite a bit. I believe the keycard should be produced
from a different guard at the start of the level.  In addition to giving the
labratory rooms more caracter.  The bathroom layout isn't that interesting and
could be a point of modification but I am uncertian what would be better.

Main ideas

*  Move the initial keycard to open secuirty doors.
*  Better decorate interior rooms to make them feel more "alive".
*  Require more exploration into side and back rooms by having the
   gas bottles which need to be destoryed spread out.
*  Meeting up with trev early such is done in the movie may
   be more interesting?
